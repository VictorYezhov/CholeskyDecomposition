# CholeskyDecomposition
Matrix inversion using Cholesky Decomposition

This algorithm works only with SIMMETRIC AND POSITIVE DEFINE matrises!!

In work we propose an inversion algorithm which
reduces the number of operations by 16-17% compared to the
existing algorithms by avoiding computation of some known
intermediate results.
